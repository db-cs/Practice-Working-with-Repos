# Practice-Working-with-Repos

You will be following the workflow from the lesson. 

- All changes should be made locally using VS Code on a seperate branch. 
- Then you should push them to the remote `origin` and open a pull request. 
- At least one team member must review your changes before you merge it with the `main` branch.

## Tasks

1. Create a New Folder

    - The folder should be your first and last name.
    - The folder should have no spaces in the name. Instead use a `-`.
    - For example: `nathan-bailey`.

2. Add Some Information to the Folder
    
    - Add a photo your favorite superhero.
    - Add a new markdown document named `about-<superhero>`
      - Add the name of your superhero at the top as a header.
      - Add two sentences to describe why your superhero is the best.
      - Add a list of super powers.
      - Add a list of weaknesses.
